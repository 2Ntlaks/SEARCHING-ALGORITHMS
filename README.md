# Searching Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of two fundamental searching algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search. Each algorithm is organized in its own subdirectory within the `SEARCHING ALGORITHMS` folder.

## Folder Structure

- `LinearSearch/`: Contains the implementation of the Linear Search algorithm.
- `BinarySearch/`: Contains the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.

## Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

- **Folder:** `LinearSearch/`
- **Class:** `LinearSearchArray`
- **Description:**
  - Generates an array of random integers.
  - Allows the user to search for a value in the array using linear search.
  - Displays the index of the value if found, or a message indicating that the value is not in the array.

### 2. Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

- **Folder:** `BinarySearch/`
- **Class:** `BinarySearchArray`
- **Description:**
  - Generates a sorted array of random integers.
  - Allows the user to search for a value in the array using binary search.
  - Displays the index of the value if found, or a message indicating that the value is not in the array.
  - Also displays the number of iterations required to find the value.

## How to Run

To run the algorithms, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/searching-algorithms.git
   ```
